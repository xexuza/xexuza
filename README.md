Okay so From introduction my name Is xexuza not my real name its a 
"alias" okay so bit information about me is Im a student senior high
school,17 year old,Basically what Im interested is in doing android 
development thing's,and I do sport's also like basketball and chess
And beside's that i also have social media's acc like 
github,Instagram,Telegram,Facebook,youtube,twitter,and tiktok
curiousity on android motivates me Im a fan of android since
2015 when I have my first LG device
So if enumerating on what I do is 

Modifying Rom's(I do this to reduce the rom size and to make it
smoother on device's,easy right?)

Porting rom(I port rom without pc(yep i do this but it's a challenge
because no pc,it means hard work)

creating custom kernel(Experimental)(making kernel using android Is
almost a impossible task,but still trying because its a big advancement
when I did that)

Modifying apk(Basically I do this when a app consume so much 
resource or ram,reducing its size,not good at this one)

Vulkan(Using the native sources of 7870 to run it without error's,we 
Have the vulkan but unstable but still trying to give it a chance)

Oppo a37f(Backup)
samsung j7 pro(secondary device)
redmi 7a(first pick)

I dont respond fast on social media's Because of study,so dont expect
a lightning respond
